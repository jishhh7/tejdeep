          <h2>Happy Birthday Cutiee 🎉</h2>
          <p>
            Wowww u r turning 19 (grown up)<br><br>
            I'll always love you deep in heart.<br>
            Even if we're not together, you'll always be my cutiee whom I've irritated, teased, annoyed, loved a lot.<br>
            Spending time with you was the most memorable time for me.<br><br>
            Ukw, I'm missing youuu so badly Tejdeep, it feels like hell trust me!!<br>
            You're one of the best people I've ever met so far.<br>
            Our first meet felt like a dream to me — you walking beside me in the night with rain drizzling — it was perfect.😭<br><br>
            I was so sleepy during our movie date 'cause I didn’t sleep at night, was thinking about our first meet 😁<br>
            And even when the whole world knew about us, I didn’t care. Just wanted more time with you.<br><br>
            Our last meet — I was angry, then I wasn't... that’s what you do to me 😭<br>
            I had my first kiss, chocolate from my love, a perfect day...<br><br>
            Tejdeep, you will always be my special one.<br>
            If I could time travel, I'd go back to those moments.<br><br>
            I hope you had a memorable time with me too.<br>
            Did you?<br><br>
            I’m so sorry... and I love you 💖
